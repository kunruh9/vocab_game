# Vocabulary Game - Initial Requirements

## MVP Requirements

### 1. Word Recall Feature
  - Display a single word definition at a time
  - Display also includes a text input the word which has the given definition
  - Compare user's input against the correct word using case-insensitive string comparison
  - Provide immediate feedback on whether the word was correct
  - Simple navigation to move to the next definition
  - Each Session is limited to 10 definitions
  - Maintain a simple scoring system:
    - Each correct awards one point
    - Each incorrect awards zero points
    - Session TTL -- no global score tracking and history for MVP
  - Keep the current Session score displayed at the top of the screen
  - The user can quit a Session early at any time
  - When a Session ends, display the User's score (e.g. "6/10 points!")

### 2. Word Data Management
- Initial dataset of 1,000-2,000 advanced/uncommon English words
- Store words and definitions locally on user's device
- Package data with application (estimated size: 1-2MB)
- Simple JSON format for word storage
- Each word entry includes:
  - Word
  - Definition
  - Example usage

### 3. Technical Considerations
- Web-based application (for cross-platform compatibility)
- Simple deployment strategy
- Easy to extend for future features

## Questions for Refinement

### 3. Technical Stack
- Do you have any preferences for the frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.)?
- Any specific styling preferences (CSS framework, design system)?
- Any backend requirements for the initial version?

### 4. Deployment
- Do you have a preferred hosting platform in mind?
- Any specific domain/subdomain requirements?
