# Vocabulary Game - Initial Requirements

## MVP Requirements

### 1. Word Recall Feature
- Display a single word definition at a time
- Provide a text input field for users to enter the word
- Compare user's input against the correct word using direct string comparison
- Provide immediate feedback on whether the word was correct
- Simple navigation to move to the next definition

### 2. Word Data Management
- Initial dataset of 1,000-2,000 advanced/uncommon English words
- Store words and definitions locally on user's device
- Package data with application (estimated size: 1-2MB)
- Simple JSON format for word storage
- Each word entry includes:
  - Word
  - Definition
  - Example usage

### 3. User Experience
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Intuitive card navigation

### 4. Data Management
- Basic progress tracking
- Local storage for user progress

### 5. Technical Considerations
- Web-based application (for cross-platform compatibility)
- Simple deployment strategy
- Easy to extend for future features

## Questions for Refinement

### 2. User Interaction
- Should we track correct/incorrect attempts for each word?
- Would you like to include a simple scoring system in the initial version?
- Should we track learning progress over time?
- How should we handle case sensitivity in word matching?

### 3. Technical Stack
- Do you have any preferences for the frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.)?
- Any specific styling preferences (CSS framework, design system)?
- Any backend requirements for the initial version?

### 4. Deployment
- Do you have a preferred hosting platform in mind?
- Any specific domain/subdomain requirements?
