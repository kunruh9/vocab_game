# Vocabulary Game - Initial Requirements

## Core Requirements

### 1. Word Recall Feature
- Display a single word definition at a time
- Provide a text input field for users to enter the word
- Compare user's input against the correct word using direct string comparison
- Provide immediate feedback on whether the word was correct
- Simple navigation to move to the next definition

### 2. User Experience
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Intuitive card navigation

### 3. Data Management
- Initial set of vocabulary words and definitions
- Basic progress tracking
- Local storage for user progress

### 4. Technical Considerations
- Web-based application (for cross-platform compatibility)
- Simple deployment strategy
- Easy to extend for future features

## Future Improvements

### 1. Definition Recall Feature
- Display a single word at a time
- Provide a text input field for users to enter the definition
- Compare user's input against the correct definition using direct string matching
- Provide immediate feedback on whether the definition was correct
- Simple navigation to move to the next word

### 2. Enhanced Definition Comparison
- Implement more sophisticated comparison logic beyond direct string matching
- Consider semantic similarity for definition matching
- Allow for partial credit on close but not exact matches
- Support multiple acceptable definitions for the same word

## Questions for Refinement

### 1. Word Selection
- How would you like to source the initial vocabulary words?
- Should we start with a specific category or difficulty level?
- How many words should be included in the initial set?
- Should we include example sentences with the definitions?

### 2. User Interaction
- Should we track correct/incorrect attempts for each word?
- Would you like to include a simple scoring system in the initial version?
- Should we track learning progress over time?
- How should we handle case sensitivity in word matching?

### 3. Technical Stack
- Do you have any preferences for the frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.)?
- Any specific styling preferences (CSS framework, design system)?
- Any backend requirements for the initial version?

### 4. Deployment
- Do you have a preferred hosting platform in mind?
- Any specific domain/subdomain requirements?
