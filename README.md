# Vocabulary Game

A project for learning and practicing vocabulary words.

## Current Focus: MVP Requirements

We are currently in the planning phase, focusing on defining the core requirements for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). This will help ensure we build exactly what's needed before moving to implementation.

### Project Structure

```
vocab_game/

## Next Steps

1. Define core MVP features and requirements
2. Design data structures for vocabulary words
3. Plan user interaction flow
4. Create technical specifications
