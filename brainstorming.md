## Motivation & Goal

The English language may supersede writing actual source code in the near future. Based on my experience working with Generative AI to build Software Applications is very much an exercise in clear communication. It's not about how _much_ you write, but how well you can articulate your vision. Sometimes, guiding the AI through an iterative process of concise prompts is more effective than trying to "describe the world".

For the basic implementation of this game, I want to keep the goal very simple: learn uncommon (or advanced?) English words and their definitions. This alone, IMO, is not enough in itself to make a good Prompt Engineer. But it will help, and that's good enough for now.


### Brainstorming

(Ideas ordered by my perceived importance, but I'm open to considering changing the ranking)

1. Can be played on phone, tablet, computer (via browser?)
    - This might mean it's easier to use a "shell" app for mobile devices which essentially renders the same web components and such that you would get in the browser
2. Clean look and feel, not like a cluttered mobile game
    - Mobile-first focused UI design
3. Should this be basically a flashcard app with a timer and scoring logic? That's been done many times before, so it doesn't exactly bring anything new to the table, so to speak.
    - I think it would be nice to have some sort of "gamification" that still helps build the memory, but in a unique and engaging way (easy as that, right? ðŸ˜…)
4. Separate from the gamification aspect of the app, it would be really cool to be able to have an input where you can describe something and the app can give you back a list of words whose definition most closely matches the input description
5. Leaderboards?
6. Friends list?
7. Real competition with other users?
